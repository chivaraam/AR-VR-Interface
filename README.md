# DESCRIPTION :

Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) are transformative technologies that offer unique ways to interact with digital content. AR enhances the real world by overlaying digital elements onto physical surroundings using devices like smartphones or AR glasses. It provides interactive experiences such as virtual try-ons, navigation, and real-time information. In contrast, VR immerses users in entirely digital environments through headsets, creating experiences like virtual travel, gaming, and simulations for training or education. While AR blends digital and physical realities, VR replaces the real world with a fully virtual one, each unlocking innovative possibilities across various industries.
